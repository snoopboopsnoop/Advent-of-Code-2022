## Overview
Each folder contains 2 solutions to its respective day. Run them alongside your input from https://adventofcode.com/2022.
`*note: it is possible that the solutions may not work for your input; the code has only been tested against the examples on the Advent of Code page and my given input.`

## Working with your input
With C++ installed, simply create a file titled `input.txt` in the corresponding day's folder, paste your puzzle input, and run its respective C++ file.
